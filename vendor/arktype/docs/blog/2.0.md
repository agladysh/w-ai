# Announcing ArkType 2.0 100x faster validation with DX that will blow your mind

As of today, `arktype@2.0.0` is generally available and fully stable.

ArkType 2.0 brings types to runtime JS in a way that, until today, has been a pipedream.

Whether you're a first-time TypeScript dev trying to validate a form or a library author introspecting relationships,
ArkType offers fundamentally better tools for navigating the perils of JavaScript.

Playground Mode

Type-level feedback with each keystroke- **no plugins or build steps required**.

### [Unparalleled DX](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#unparalleled-dx)

Type syntax you already know with safety and completions unlike anything you've ever seen

```
const User = type({
 name: "string",
 platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
 "version?": "number | snumber | stringnumber | symbol"
})
```

### [Faster... everything](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#faster-everything)

100x faster than Zod at runtime with editor performance that will remind you how autocomplete is supposed to feel

###### Object Validation, Node v23.6.1

ArkType ‚ö° 14 nanoseconds

Zod üëç 281 nanoseconds

Yup üêå 40755 nanoseconds\*

\*scaling generously logarithmized

### [Clarity and Concision](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#clarity-and-concision)

Definitions are half as long, type errors are twice as readable, and hovers tell you just what really matters

```
// hover me
const User = type({
 name: "string",
 platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
 "versions?": "number | string)[]"
TypeScript: Unmatched ) before []‚Ää})
```

### [Better Errors](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#better-errors)

Deeply customizable messages with great defaults

```
const out = User({
 name: "Alan Turing",
 platform: "enigma",
 versions: [0, "1", 0n]
})

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
 // hover summary to see validation errors
 console.error(out.summary)
}
```

### [Deep Introspectability](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#deep-introspectability)

ArkType uses set theory to understand and expose the relationships between your types at runtime the way TypeScript does
at compile time

```
User.extends("object") // true
User.extends("string") // false
// true (string is narrower than unknown)
User.extends({
 name: "unknown"
})
// false (string is wider than "Alan")
User.extends({
 name: "'Alan'"
})
```

### [Intrinsic Optimization](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#intrinsic-optimization)

Every schema is internally normalized and reduced to its purest and fastest representation

```
// all unions are optimally discriminated
// even if multiple/nested paths are needed
const Account = type({
 kind: "'admin'",
 "powers?": "string[]"
}).or({
 kind: "'superadmin'",
 "superpowers?": "string[]"
}).or({
 kind: "'pleb'"
})
```

### [What next?](https://arktype.io/docs/blog/2.0#what-next)

ArkType doesn't require a special environment or build step to work- [our intro](https://arktype.io/docs/intro/setup)
will have you up and running in seconds.

We have [big plans](https://github.com/orgs/arktypeio/projects/4) to ArkType 2.0 even further, but we're even more
excited to see what you do with it!
